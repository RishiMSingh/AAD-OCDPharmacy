# AAD-OCDPharmacy

During the COVID-19 pandemic local pharamacies faced a problem with patients coming in and experiencing delays with the collection of their prescriptions.
The local pharamcy tasked my team to create a medication collection system that took into account exisiting medicines, prescriptions and blood tests. 
Using Flask and MySQLite users are able to order their prescriptions for collection and book a time for collection. This system also allows the pharmacists
and technicians to make changes to the order.
